We ran the object detector we provided in Exercise 0 and applied to all frames. We also computed reid embeddings for all boxes in every frame of the dataset so that they don't need to be computed every time you run your tracker. This yields over 10x speed improvements. You will not have to work directly with the resulting files, as we have internally adapted the boilerplate code to work with them."

    "Our ``LongTermReIDHungarianTracker`` is still limited when compared to current modern trackers. \n",

    "Firstly, it relies solely on appearance to predict similarity scores between objectes. This can be problematic whenever appearance alone may not discriminative, and it'd be best to also take into account object position and size attributes. Secondly, our tracker can only account for pairwise similarities among objects. Ideally, we would like it to also consider higher-order information.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these limitations. We will now build a tracker that will combine both apperance and position information with a Message Passing Neural Network, inspired by the approach presented in [Learning a Neural Solver for Multiple Object Tracking, CVPR 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07515)\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall idea will be to build, for every tracking step, a bipartite graph containing two sets of nodes: past tracks, and detections in the current frame. We will initialize node features with ReID embeddings, and edge features with relative position features and ReID distance. We will use an MPN to refine these edge embeddings. The learning task will be to classify the edge embeddings in this graph, which is equivalent to predicting the entries of our data association similarity matrix.\n"
